## Customisation

### Editing Post Fields

You can change the fields used in your Trackstar log by editing the `post_fields` values in the `trackstar.yaml` config file. The format is:
```yaml
post_fields:
  field_name: conversation_method
```
where `conversation_method` is a Ruby String method for type conversion.

### Editing Post Formatting

You can add formatting to the post Markdown by editing the `post_formatting` values in the `trackstar.yaml` config file. The format is:
```yaml
post_formatting:
  field_name: formatting_method
``` 
where `formatting_method` is a method implemented in the `Trackstar::Post` class to add formatting after a field.

Currently supported formatting methods:
- `hr_after`: Adds a horizontal rule after the field
